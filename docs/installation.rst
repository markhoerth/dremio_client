Stable release
--------------

To install basic Dremio client, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install dremio_client

This installs a minimal set of dependencies suitable for only interacting with the REST API and for restricted environments.
To get full set of dependencies run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install dremio_client[noarrow]  # everything but pyarrow
    $ pip install dremio_client[full]  # all dependencies

This is the preferred method to install Dremio client, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
